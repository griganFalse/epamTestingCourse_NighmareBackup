At first I was afraid, I was petrified!
Kept thinkin’ I could never live
without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong,
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along.

And so you're back from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with
that sad look upon your face
I shoulda changed that stupid lock,
I shoulda made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me.

Go on now go, walk out the door.
Just turn around now,
‘cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried
to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I! I will survive!
Oh, as long as I know how to love,
I know I'll stay alive.
I've got all my life to live,
And I've got all my love to give,
I'll survive, I will survive!
Hey hey..

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
And tryin' hard to mend the pieces
of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights
just feelin' sorry for myself, I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high,

And you'll see me, somebody new;
I'm not that chained up little girl
who's still in love with you.
And so you felt like dropping in
and just expect me to be free,
But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone
who's lovin' me,

Go on now go, walk out the door.
Just turn around now,
‘cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried
to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I! I will survive!
Oh as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I'll survive, I will survive!
Oh..
